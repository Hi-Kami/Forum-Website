# Forum-Website
A php forum website I created from scratch to learn php and make a website for a game I was creating.

# What I learned
* PHP and SQL
* The correct way to store passwords in a database, via encrypting them and when someone tries to log in, encrypt the password and match the encryptions.
* To create a database setup script, I stupidly created the database by hand and now have forgotten what the original databse looked like so only way I could get this website to work now is to sift thought the code and remake the database based on how the code accesses the database. Lession learned.
* That there are prebuilt forum websites, I did not know back when I created this website that there was free prebuilt forum sites which would have saved some time. However I did still learn SQL and PHP so not all bad.

# How I could improve
* Create a setup script for the database, I did not have the forsite that websites can move hosts back then but I do now.
* Use a prebuilt forum, If I was not learning I would have used a prebuilt forum and customised it as this would have saved time.
